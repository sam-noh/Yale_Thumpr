# Prismatically underactuated legged robot (name TBD)
Prismatically underactuated legged robot (name TBD) is a full mobility legged robot that can traverse rough terrains with reduced sensing and actuation by passively adapting to them during ground contact. It has a total of six motors and walks by using an alternating gait.

## Features
- simple swing leg control via a joint torque profile that minimizes postural disturbance
- ground contact estimation using joint states
- parameterized swing leg trajectory to adapt to varying terrain roughness and slopes
- body height and pose regulation during the gait cycle using proprioceptive sensing
