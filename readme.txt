Robot control code v1.2

Changes:
	Changed to ODrive Pro
	Updated the CAN commands as necessary

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality:
1. teleoperation by a joystick
2. position control of the motors with trapezoidal trajectory (generated by the ODrive motor controllers)
3. gait phase transition based on motor position
4. adaptive leg trajectory based on terrain roughness
5. torque control of the leg touchdown
   each leg motor is tested to determine the (1) minimum torque command needed to begin motion
   each leg motor is then tested to determine a (2) lower torque command that can keep the legs moving
   control of the leg touchdown is done by first sending the (1) min torque command and
   then sending the (2) lower torque command after the motor has moved some nominal distance
		
6. ground contact estimation using motor velocity (contact if velocity close to zero)
7. body tilt correction based on proprioception (IMU pose estimation)
