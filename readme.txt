Robot control code v1.5

Changes:
	changed from I2C to SPI on the BNO085 IMU
	offloaded the IMU to a second Teensy for faster cycle and added the corresponding .ino (Teensy_IMU.ino)
	added IMU zeroing before starting
	added a motor command manager for centralized updated over CAN
	changed motor power monitoring from using a current sensor to an average of bus voltage/current readings from ODrives
	improved cycle time and increased sampling/update frequencies
	updated and reduced the number of independent leg trajectory parameters
	updated and fixed gait phase transition logic
	added ground contact estimation based on either motor velocity or leg encoder velocity
	added gait parameter update based on higher-level controller (Jetson over UART)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality:
1. position control of translation and yaw motors
2. position control of leg motors in swing (trapezoidal trajectory generated by ODrive)
3. torque control of leg motors during touchdown
4. zero torque command of leg motors in stance
5. adaptive swing leg trajectory based on last ground contact conditions
6. body tilt correction using proprioception (IMU pose estimation)
7. body height correction based on kinematics
